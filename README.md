# Vanilla JavaScript Digital Clock App

A simple clock app written entirely in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This application displays the current date and time, and a button to toggle between standard and military time.

# Summary

Recently, I started the journey to become a software developer. Reading all the books I could on web development, computer science fundamentals, and taking online tutorials, I decided to start building applications on my own. This is my first application I built on my own. Although a simple clock application, I still learned valuable problem solving and JavaScript concepts.
